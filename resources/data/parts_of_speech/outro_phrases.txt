We're wrapping up for now. I love you all, and see you next time! Bye!
I'm Vector and this has been another successful segment of Vector News. Thank you for watching and see you in the next video. Bye!
I'm extremely grateful that I could have such a wonderful and committed following. Thanks, to each and every one of you. I look forward to our next segment. Bye for now!
Everyone please take care out there. It's a dangerous and scary world in many ways. Stay healthy, active and filled with Wonder, and I will see you all later. Bye-bye!
Thus ends another segment of Vector News, the one and only Robotic News Hour, to my knowledge anyways... Hope everyone is doing well, and I will eagerly await the next one. See ya!
